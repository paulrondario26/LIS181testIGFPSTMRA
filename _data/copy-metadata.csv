While at Guam, the crew raided and torched a village whose men had stolen a small tender hanging from the flagship. Sick comrades begged that entrails of the newly killed Guamanians be fed to them! European civilisation during the Renaisssance still practised medical cannibalism, an ancient use of human body parts and fluids in curing. Romans drank the blood of slain gladiators hoping for vitality. They even suggested drinking blood form the arms of young people. In the 1500s, medical cannibalism is said to have reached its height. Vampire tales and medical cannibalism are linked.",Armada de Maluco; medical cannibalism; Samar; Guam,,,,https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/277393658273965001/,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,Public domain,https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CMbHGQAnPHA/

Their destination was Maluco, also called the Spice Islands of today's Indonesia. Trinidad was the flagship with around 61 men to feed including Ferdinand Magellan, the fleet's chief. San Antonio the largest by tonnage had 57 men, the Concepcion where Sebastian Elcano was assigned had a crew of 44, the Victoria had 44, and the smallest ship the Santiago had 31. Daily rations were computed for 237 persons although the actual number sailing is uncertain because manifests are not identical. The food was to last two years. The fleet left on August 10, 1519. They should have food to last till August 9, 1521. Only the Victoria skippered by Elcano returned on September 6, 1522. Only 18 of the original voyagers survived. Hunger and starvation were enemies of all voyages, especially a voyage of exploration such as that of the Armada de Maluco.",Armada de Maluco; Ferdinand Magellan; Sebastian Elcano; Trinidad; San Antonio; Concepcion; Victoria; Santiago; Spice Islands; Indonesia,,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/CM0vJi-Hxi8/

It sought a maritime route from the Atlantic via South America into the Spice Islands. There was enough salted and dried food for two years that constantly needed replenishment of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, potable water, and firewood. Sailors recognised hunger, scurvy, and beriberi as enemies just like storms and shipwreck. Magellan sensing a long journey, decreased daily rations as allowed legally. In December 1519, four months into the provisions some men grumbled and asked to increase their food. Magellan appealed to their loyalty to the Crown and appeased them. He reminded that they had been finding abundant fresh food since they had left Spain. But the next year on the night of Palm Sunday April 1 , 1520 some officers mutinied! They seized three of the boats, then ransacked and distributed food to the crew hoping to win their loyalty for a trip back to Spain. They were 8 months into the journey. Two leaders were executed and two other instigators exiled to Patagonia. Forty of the crew were not executed because they were needed to sail the ships. One ship got wrecked and it seems its provisions went down with the boat although the crew survived. They transferred to the remaining four boats that stretched their food to accommodate them. By August 1520 the armada had reached the midway point of their stored provisions. In November of 1520, Magellan discovered the passage that led to the unknown Pacific Ocean. The San Antonio deserted and returned to Spain. Magellan should have had 8 months of food left when the remaining 3 ships crossed the Pacific Ocean on November 28, 1520. But they did not expect the vastness of the Pacific they were discovering for Europe. They survived by eating rats, the main yard cover made of ox hide, and sawdust from the ship's boards. They were unable to fish in the deep waters. The provisions had spoiled and ran out during the 3 months and 20 days it took them to reach Guam.",Ferdinand Magellan; Armada de Maluco; Guam; Spain; Spice Islands; Patagonia; mutiny,,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNB4DMRHEYp/

Conforming to the Catholic rituals was important to the crew. Their lives were constantly in peril, especially from storms and hunger. The first Palm Sunday was 8 months into their provisions to last 2 years. They had anchored at St. Julian port in Argentina where autumn was starting in the Southern Hemisphere. The geese and sea-wolves they hunted as fresh food were penguins and seals, respectively. In 1521, Palm Sunday was at Homonhon Island, Samar form where on Holy Monday they sailed south. By Good Friday, March 29 according to Pigafetta's reckoning, they were in Mazaua (Limasawa) of Southern Leyte. Their Easter Sunday was celebrated with a meal of two swine given by Datus Colambu and Siauri. The meal was cooked on board. The last Holy Week (with Elcano now skippering the Victoria) found them somewhere in the Indian Ocean where on April 16 they headed north to Africa. Modern calculations identify March 26, 1522 as Easter Sunday. There was no feasting. The men were suffering inanition and catabolysis: the effects of extreme starvation. Whatever provisions they had loaded in Tidore, the center for clove, had deteriorated or been consumed. Their Philippine Holy Week, with Magellan still alive, was the friendliest of their foreign Easters.","Ferdinand Magellan; Sebastian Elcano; Antonio Pigafetta; Datu Colambu; Datu Siauri; Spice Islands; Argentina; Homonhon Island, Samar; Limasawa; Mazaua; Leyte; Tidore",,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/CM_ZNI7HlgC/

Pigafetta and comrades ate 35 different meats including peacock during a welcome meal sent to them by the Bornean Sultan.  For their audience with him, they were fetched by elephants. One wonders what was served at the farewell meal hosted by Humabon in Cebu after Magellan’s death.  He invited the crew and said he would give them the gold jewelry they knew he had had crafted for the Spanish King.  The new Armada leader wanted to secure from Humabon guides who knew the route to the Moluccas. The meal turned out to be a trap and almost everyone who went was massacred. Pigafetta had been wounded in the face by an arrow and was swollen, so could not go.  The three ships left immediately. One wonders if the Armada would have gotten to the Spiceries quicker than they had if Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique were with them. Magellan had likely reached Mindanao from Portuguese territories when he was still a soldier-sailor for the country of his birth. No one knows with certainty what was Enrique’s fate. Wanting freedom, did he plan the massacre with Humabon? Others suggest he was killed because he wore Spanish garments and would have been mistaken for one. Was Lapulapu in with the plot? No one knows for sure. Food could be used for friendship, peace and trade negotiations, but also as a weapon of stealth.",Cebu; Pigafetta; Bornean Sultan; ,,,,Lapulapu on the RP P500 bill,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,

The domesticated varieties were usually prestige foods used in pagan rituals for thanksgiving and when requesting bountiful food, safe childbirth, and healing.  The crew of mixed European ethnicities also found familiar fish, crab, goat, citruses, bananas, honey, salt, ginger, garlic, rice, millet, panicum and sorghum. Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique would have known the foods of Insular Southeast Asia. Pigafetta from Vicenza seems to have tried coconut for the first time. He wrote of its uses as wine, vinegar, oil, water, milk and a substitute for bread. Although rice was cooked in a clay pot above fire as in Spain, rice was also cooked in a bamboo tube placed under fire.  He found cakes wrapped in leaves, some of rice and others of millet.  One rice cake was called tinapay, according to him. Other foods he and his mates may have found unusual were bat meat, turtle eggs and tabon eggs. He heard about a delicacy called Laghan Snails found attached to the hearts of dead whales. Like explorers over the millennia and even today, the Armada’s crew had to eat whatever would keep them alive.",Philippines; Pigafetta; Laghan Snails,,,,Commemorative Coin,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,

Ships and villages were raided for supplies. Hostages were ransomed for food. In Cebu, Magellan required a food quota for chiefs loyal to Rajah Humabon. Humabon, the Captain’s blood brother, had pledged allegiance to the Spanish King. He was expected to assist the royal armada. When one village refused to give its quota, Magellan burned it. Such terrorist tactics were an underlying cause for the Battle of Mactan. Lapulapu spurned the order. He fought to protect his people and their right to food security. Political competition among local chiefs was likely not his sole motive. The year the circumnavigation ended. Basilica of Santi Nazaro e Celso at Brescia, Lombardy. Antonio Pigafetta was from the Republic of Venice, a rival in the spice trade. The passenger manifesto does not name him. It lists an Antonio Lombardo, Lombardy being within Spain’s Italian realm. He was among those added legally beyond the passenger cut off.

There could have been roughly 160 men for Magellan to find new water and food for. The peaceful strategies were firstly, to fish, hunt and forage at uninhabited islands or places where islanders allowed them to. The swine eaten at Homonhon Island may have been hunted there. No mention is made if they were carried from Guam. A second means is to receive food as gifts. The 9 men from Samar’s Suluan Island, the first of ancestral Filipinos to encounter the Spanish Armada, gave fish, 2 coconuts, assorted banana, and a jar of native wine from their supplies. One suspects the Europeans could not have fattened up in the 10 days from the time they secured food in Guam to the time they met the Suluans. The natives could have recognised the look of sailors who had suffered extreme hunger. The third means is to barter for food. The Suluans returned after 4 days with rice, chicken and other foodstuff which were paid for with beads, caps, textiles, clothing and other goods. But the ships carried only a finite amount of trade items and they were needed to purchase spices in Maluco, their ultimate destination. ",Suluan Island; Cruxificion,,,,Wikimedia.

Magellan died in April so did not experience the crew’s first stop at a Muslim settlement. It was on July 9 that several  canoes accompanying a beautiful prau with 8 elderly chiefs and musicians in it approached them. The prau decorated in gold flew from its bow blue and white banners topped by peacock feathers. Each of the two Spanish ships was presented with a wooden jar covered in yellow silk and filled with betelnut chew and orange blossoms.  Two cages with fowl, several goats, bundles of sugarcane, and three jars of distilled rice wine as clear as water were also given.  Six days later a spectacle of three praus with musicians playing drums and gongs came with foods made only of rice, some wrapped in leaves, some shaped like loaves, and others made like tarts with eggs and honey. The Armada gave presents to the 7 chiefs and herald in the group and sent through them gifts for the king, queen, and governor.
