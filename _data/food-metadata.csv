European civilisation during the Renaisssance still practised medical cannibalism, an ancient use of human body parts and fluids in curing. Romans drank the blood of slain gladiators hoping for vitality. They even suggested drinking blood form the arms of young people. In the 1500s, medical cannibalism is said to have reached its height.

San Antonio the largest by tonnage had 57 men, the Concepcion where Sebastian Elcano was assigned had a crew of 44, the Victoria had 44, and the smallest ship the Santiago had 31. Daily rations were computed for 237 persons although the actual number sailing is uncertain because manifests are not identical. The food was to last two years. The fleet left on August 10, 1519. They should have food to last till August 9, 1521. Only the Victoria skippered by Elcano returned on September 6, 1522. Only 18 of the original voyagers survived.

It sought a maritime route from the Atlantic via South America into the Spice Islands. There was enough salted and dried food for two years that constantly needed replenishment of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, potable water, and firewood. Sailors recognised hunger, scurvy, and beriberi as enemies just like storms and shipwreck. Magellan sensing a long journey, decreased daily rations as allowed legally. In December 1519, four months into the provisions some men grumbled and asked to increase their food. Magellan appealed to their loyalty to the Crown and appeased them. He reminded that they had been finding abundant fresh food since they had left Spain. But the next year on the night of Palm Sunday April 1 , 1520 some officers mutinied! They seized three of the boats, then ransacked and distributed food to the crew hoping to win their loyalty for a trip back to Spain. They were 8 months into the journey. Two leaders were executed and two other instigators exiled to Patagonia. Forty of the crew were not executed because they were needed to sail the ships. One ship got wrecked and it seems its provisions went down with the boat although the crew survived. They transferred to the remaining four boats that stretched their food to accommodate them. By August 1520 the armada had reached the midway point of their stored provisions. In November of 1520, Magellan discovered the passage that led to the unknown Pacific Ocean. The San Antonio deserted and returned to Spain. Magellan should have had 8 months of food left when the remaining 3 ships crossed the Pacific Ocean on November 28, 1520. But they did not expect the vastness of the Pacific they were discovering for Europe. They survived by eating rats, the main yard cover made of ox hide, and sawdust from the ship's boards. They were unable to fish in the deep waters. The provisions had spoiled and ran out during the 3 months and 20 days it took them to reach Guam.",Ferdinand Magellan; Armada de Maluco; Guam; Spain; Spice Islands; Patagonia; mutiny,Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative Magellan coin.,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/CNB4DMRHEYp/

HOLY WEEK ABSTINENCE,,,"The expedition to the Spice Islands with Magellan in command experienced Holy Weeks in 1520, 1521, and 1522. Conforming to the Catholic rituals was important to the crew. Their lives were constantly in peril, especially from storms and hunger. The first Palm Sunday was 8 months into their provisions to last 2 years. They had anchored at St. Julian port in Argentina where autumn was starting in the Southern Hemisphere. The geese and sea-wolves they hunted as fresh food were penguins and seals, respectively. In 1521, Palm Sunday was at Homonhon Island, Samar form where on Holy Monday they sailed south. By Good Friday, March 29 according to Pigafetta's reckoning, they were in Mazaua (Limasawa) of Southern Leyte. Their Easter Sunday was celebrated with a meal of two swine given by Datus Colambu and Siauri. The meal was cooked on board. The last Holy Week (with Elcano now skippering the Victoria) found them somewhere in the Indian Ocean where on April 16 they headed north to Africa. Modern calculations identify March 26, 1522 as Easter Sunday. There was no feasting. The men were suffering inanition and catabolysis: the effects of extreme starvation. Whatever provisions they had loaded in Tidore, the center for clove, had deteriorated or been consumed. Their Philippine Holy Week, with Magellan still alive, was the friendliest of their foreign Easters.","Ferdinand Magellan; Sebastian Elcano; Antonio Pigafetta; Datu Colambu; Datu Siauri; Spice Islands; Argentina; Homonhon Island, Samar; Limasawa; Mazaua; Leyte; Tidore",Magellan Menu,,,Commemorative collectible for the Quincentennial,,Image;Still Image,image/png,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/CM_ZNI7HlgC/

Pigafetta and comrades ate 35 different meats including peacock during a welcome meal sent to them by the Bornean Sultan.  For their audience with him, they were fetched by elephants. One wonders what was served at the farewell meal hosted by Humabon in Cebu after Magellan’s death.  He invited the crew and said he would give them the gold jewelry they knew he had had crafted for the Spanish King.  The new Armada leader wanted to secure from Humabon guides who knew the route to the Moluccas. The meal turned out to be a trap and almost everyone who went was massacred. Pigafetta had been wounded in the face by an arrow and was swollen, so could not go.  The three ships left immediately. One wonders if the Armada would have gotten to the Spiceries quicker than they had if Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique were with them. Magellan had likely reached Mindanao from Portuguese territories when he was still a soldier-sailor for the country of his birth. No one knows with certainty what was Enrique’s fate. Wanting freedom, did he plan the massacre with Humabon? Others suggest he was killed because he wore Spanish garments and would have been mistaken for one. Was Lapulapu in with the plot? No one knows for sure.

RESTOCKING,,,"Renaissance food preservation for naval voyages was limited to mostly dried, salted and dried, or brined foods.  Replenishing fresh supplies including water was mandatory for survival. Fresh foods the circumnavigation crew found in the Philippines included some familiar to them like pigs and chickens.  The domesticated varieties were usually prestige foods used in pagan rituals for thanksgiving and when requesting bountiful food, safe childbirth, and healing.  The crew of mixed European ethnicities also found familiar fish, crab, goat, citruses, bananas, honey, salt, ginger, garlic, rice, millet, panicum and sorghum. Magellan and his Malay slave Enrique would have known the foods of Insular Southeast Asia. Pigafetta from Vicenza seems to have tried coconut for the first time. He wrote of its uses as wine, vinegar, oil, water, milk and a substitute for bread. Although rice was cooked in a clay pot above fire as in Spain, rice was also cooked in a bamboo tube placed under fire.  He found cakes wrapped in leaves, some of rice and others of millet.  One rice cake was called tinapay, according to him. Other foods he and his mates may have found unusual were bat meat, turtle eggs and tabon eggs. He heard about a delicacy called Laghan Snails found attached to the hearts of dead whales.

Ships and villages were raided for supplies. Hostages were ransomed for food. In Cebu, Magellan required a food quota for chiefs loyal to Rajah Humabon. Humabon, the Captain’s blood brother, had pledged allegiance to the Spanish King. He was expected to assist the royal armada. When one village refused to give its quota, Magellan burned it. Such terrorist tactics were an underlying cause for the Battle of Mactan. Lapulapu spurned the order. He fought to protect his people and their right to food security. Political competition among local chiefs was likely not his sole motive. Antonio Pigafetta was from the Republic of Venice, a rival in the spice trade. The passenger manifesto does not name him. It lists an Antonio Lombardo, Lombardy being within Spain’s Italian realm. He was among those added legally beyond the passenger cut off.

There could have been roughly 130 men for Magellan to find new water and food for. The peaceful strategies were firstly, to fish, hunt and forage at uninhabited islands or places where islanders allowed them to. The swine eaten at Homonhon Island may have been hunted there. No mention is made if they were carried from Guam. A second means is to receive food as gifts. The 9 men from Samar’s Suluan Island, the first of ancestral Filipinos to encounter the Spanish Armada, gave fish, 2 coconuts, assorted banana, and a jar of native wine from their supplies. One suspects the Europeans could not have fattened up in the 10 days from the time they secured food in Guam to the time they met the Suluans. The natives could have recognised the look of sailors who had suffered extreme hunger. The third means is to barter for food. The Suluans returned after 4 days with rice, chicken and other foodstuff which were paid for with beads, caps, textiles, clothing and other goods. But the ships carried only a finite amount of trade items and they were needed to purchase spices in Maluco, their ultimate destination.",Suluan Island; Cruxificion,Magellan Menu,,,CRUCIFIXION by Juan Flandes. 1519.

He also notes some not included in his Philippine stories. One of them is Guava that he tasted in the Malucho islands. He describes it as tasting like peach. In Renaissance art, the peach symbolised purity; a rotten or half-eaten one meant a woman's reputation was compromised. Other foods specified by Pigafetta are almonds, sweet and tasty pomegranates, watermelons, wild cucumbers, gourds, and comulicai similar to a large cucumber. He made a vocabulary of ""words spoken by Moro people in the area"" (also called ""A Malay Vocabulary"") noting they had only been there for the last 50 years having pushed the indigenous peoples upland to where the clove trees grow wild. In central Philippines he listed as food ""roots like turnips"" but he had no word for them. In the vocabulary he calls them ubi.

In the Philippines he learned to eat insular Southeast Asian style: seated on a mat instead of on a chair at a table. While some places had wooden or golden spoons, he knew eating with fingers (of only the right hand in Muslim areas) was common. Rulers had porcelain and gold plates and serving dishes. One ate coconut meat chunks or rice cooked as solid as bread. Rice was the desired cereal, a food eaten in Spain and Italy because Moors from the Near East had cultivated it when they ruled Spain. Everywhere there was swine, goat, poultry, fish. One had to carry them live and slaughter as needed. The crew did not have salt to preserve the cuts while they sailed, he wrote. All around the region were coconut, banana, possibly also sugarcane. Praus bartered firewood needed for cooking on board. Water could be bought in long bamboo tubes that needed to be stored upright. One needed attractive fabrics, hats, clothing, glass beads, and metal to exchange for food. Otherwise one used kidnapping for ransom, storming small villages, and capturing laden boats to secure food. The easterly winds they had been waiting for were blowing but they were unsure how to get home. Portuguese knew the route but they were the enemy and needed to be avoided at all costs.

His snippets also noted there was no great emperor lording over insular Southeast Asia; island kings fought each other even after intermarriage among their families; trade was an important factor for peace and political power; food was traded and given as gifts; feasting together could be a sign of friendship or a means to poison or hack away at guests. There was no campaign to make pagans Muslim. In Tidore, the crew killed all swine on board they had been keeping for food to please the Muslim King, their partner for securing clove and some nutmeg in the Moluccas. He gave them goats and poultry in exchange. It was known in the area and respected that Muslims did not like the looks and smells of pork. The provisions from Asia ran out. All the men on the carrack ""Victoria"" were starving as they reached Africa, but they refused to stop at Portuguese centres for food lest they be captured. The 18 who made it back to Sanlucar and Seville were emaciated. Their captain, Juan Sebastian Elcano (1476-1526), was rewarded by the king with gold ducats and a personal crest bearing the singular motto: Primus circumdedisti me. (You were the first to circumnavigate me.) His coat of arms is decorated with clove and cinnamon, appropriately.

After receiving two at Homonhon Island in March he wrote about how a coconut tree provided bread, wine, oil and milk. The size of a human head, a nut has a green husk thicker than two fingers. Certain filaments in the husk make a cord with which to bind native boats. Under the husk is a hard shell thicker than a walnut's that is burned and made into a useful powder. [Medicinal] Under that shell is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness eaten fresh with meat and fish as if it were bread. It tasted like almond to him; he explained it could be dried and eaten, too. In the middle of the marrowy substance is a clear, sweet, refreshing water. When that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. He described making a butter-like oil by boiling coconut marrow and water that had putrefied (fermented). When they wish to make vinegar, they let pure coconut water ferment under the sun. He learned to make coconut milk by scraping the marrow, mixing it with its own water, then straining it through cloth. He was told one tree could live to be a hundred years old.

Although fabrics, clothing, metal, hats, glass beads and other items were carried to trade for food, capturing a boat and taking prisoners to be ransomed for food was a common strategy. Word spread it was best to feed the foreigners and let them be off on their quest. On July 29, 1521 (3 months after Magallanes died), Pigafetta's colleagues captured a feared captain-general of the Bornean king. He turned out to be the son of the ""king of Luzon."" Pigafetta used ""king"" for lack of another term to mean the head or chief of a community or state whatever its size. Giovan Carvaio, their pilot, let the prince go in exchange for gold!

A TASTE OF VISAYAN FOOD,,,"The first circumnavigation crew would have satisfied their tastebud cravings the way Visayans did. One of Pigafetta’s most important observations is that the natives knew natural fermentation: coconut vinegar and alcoholic beverages of coconut, nipa, and rice. Before fermentation, tuba was sweetish. Along with honey, ripe fruits, and fresh sugarcane juice one’s sweet tooth could be satisfied. Tastebuds are warning devices of the human body, alerting when there is not enough or a surfeit of a taste that could cause sickness, even emotional imbalance. Sourness came from the coconut vinegar and native lemon. Salty was satisfied by salt. In fact Pigafetta found some dishes too salty. What could have been bitter? Charred meat as well as cinnamon and clove if they chewed on them. Maybe foraged fruits and leaves? Umami desire was satisfied by savory, “proteiny” cooked meats and meaty broths. No tastebud has been found reacting only and specifically to piquancy, so it is considered a mouth feel. Raw garlic and ginger provided the pricking to perk up a meal. Even if Pigafetta likely left out describing other culinary experiences, what he did describe celebrates how Filipinos used their surroundings to satisfy tastebuds, hunger and the dream of a good meal.

PIGAFETTA’S ELEPHANT RIDE,,,"In addition to roasting and cooking in a clay pot, Pigafetta identified a third cooking procedure practised in 1521: baking. It is first mentioned as the way cakes of rice and millet wrapped in leaves were made. The cakes were part of the ritual to consecrate a pig for sacrifice. Likely the thickly wrapped cakes were baked inside mounds of hot ash, even the remains of fires used for roasting. (The beehive oven was introduced much later.) While sailing in southern waters he arrived at Borneo. On June 15, 1521 three praus from there brought foods including rice wrapped in leaves. Some resembled sugar loaves in size and shape; others were somewhat longish. There was also rice made in the manner of tarts using egg and honey. He was fetched later by 2 elephants with silk trappings to bring him to and from the Borneo king. The elephants were preceded by a dozen men carrying porcelain jars covered with silk and containing the crew’s gifts. Borneo is really close geographically to the Philippines. One wonders if it is true that the Sultan of Sulu had elephants, their 2 progenitors a gift from the ruler of Java that is also nearby. Dwarf elephants lived on Luzon 2,580,000 to 11,700 years ago.

Pigafetta recorded that at the time there was not only roasting but, in earthenware pots, cooking. Perhaps the broths with fish or pork were made in them. But he also recorded cooking in bamboo tubes. Broths can be cooked in them as well in shells. Pigafetta preferred the rice cooked in bamboo to that cooked in a pot. He wrote that leaves were used as a pot liner when rice was cooked. In Cebu tagnáwan tree leaves were known in the 19th century to serve the purpose. One wonders if they may have been used because Pigafetta knew banana leaves but did not say they lined pots. In the Philippines the earliest earthenware so far found by the Philippine National Museum is 7,340 years old and from Tawi-Tawi.

Roasting is an early, basic cooking technique. One only needs an open fire to roast. RP archaeological sites in Tawi Tawi and Butuan, areas within the scope of Pigafetta’s voyage had remains of cooked food, likely roasted, as far back as 7,000 years ago and the 11th and 12th centuries of the Common Era, respectively. It was likely 400,000 to 360,000 BC when our ancestor, Homo erectus hominid (Peking man) of the Middle Pleistocene era used fire to cook hunted deer.",Lapu-lapu; Roasting; Antonio Pigafetta,Magellan Menu,,,LAPULAPU painted by Fernando Amorsolo in 1951.

Pigafetta was made a Knight of the Order of Rhodes (and Malta) for his valour. His family resided in a “palacio” – although not a grand and large one when compared with those of royalty.

Sorghum is a grass grown for grain and fodder. Today it is the “propinquum” kind of sorghum that Southeast Asia and China cultivate. The third cereal thriving in 1521 was rice that the chronicler said was called BUGHAX BARAS. Perhaps the first word, pronounced “bughas” is today’s BUGAS.

He had distinguished himself in the Portuguese military and maritime service, even reaching Malacca under Alfonso d’Albuquerque who sought to expand the Portuguese empire. Magallanes was no stranger to Asia when he got to the Philippines in 1521. He would have known bananas, coconuts, and other foods that a European crew could live on when food loaded in Spain ran out.

Pigafetta wrote that his co-crew were always invited by the Cebuanos to eat and drink with them, whether day or night. “Their viands are half cooked and very salty. They drink frequently and copiously from the jars through those small reeds,” Pigafetta wrote.

Millet was likely the fall-back cereal during drought when rice would not grow. Today humas is better known as KABOG, actually the word for fruit bat. It seems fruit bats eat millet and in northern Cebu’s town of Catmon, rice cake of millet is called BUDBUD KABOG. There is even an annual budbud kabog festival every February 10.

WHEN BREAD MEANT RICE CAKE,,,"Tinapay, today’s Filipino word for wheat bread, originally meant “a certain kind of rice cake.” We owe that fact to Pigafetta who in 1521 listed words in the Cebuano area and their meanings. He did not describe tinapay so no one knows what it really was. Did he not encounter other rice cakes, what we call kakanin now? Missionaries of the later 1500s used tinapay as the word for host when explaining it to new native converts. In the 1800s, tinapay was described by the Recollect priest Juan Felix De Encarnación as a flour circle with a sweet filling that was folded in half to resemble the moon. Perhaps because it resembled the circular host, tinapay was selected by pioneering missionaries. They also used tinapay for wheat bread when referring to miracles of Jesus Christ such as feeding a multitude with just a few fish and bread loaves. Filipinos did not know wheat or wheat bread at the time. They were brought by the Spanish. Later “hostia” was introduced as the word for host; tinapay stayed as generic for wheat bread.

In 1521 he wrote that the Cebuano word for vino (wine) was TUBA NIO NIPA. Tuba wine was made from distilling the juice of nipa, the only palm growing in water. The sap flowed from a cut made in a flower stalk (where the globular fruit would grow) conveniently located near the ground. A bamboo pitcher was hung on a joint till it filled with about 2 litres of sap that would ferment into intoxicating wine. Everyone drank too much almost everyday and slept so well that work was put off by Spanish and natives alike. Nipa, pronounced with slight differences, is the local term for “Nipa fruticans” in Indonesia, Malaysia, Antique, Cebu, Leyte, Panay, Samar, Camarines, Albay, Sorsogon, Pampanga, Pangasinan. In other parts of the Philippines it is called sasa or lasa. Into the 1920s nipa was considered a most important plant from an economic standpoint. It was not only still popular as an alcoholic drink but as vinegar. Nipa has feathery leaves stretching 7 meters high and sprouts from a root growing in soil under the waterline. The palm grew in dense clusters hard to penetrate and thus served as a defensive barrier when invaders rowed upstream. In Pangil Bay, Mindanao there was a 9,000 hectare area where nipa grew! North of Manila Bay, mangrove trees were replaced by nipa. Today, nipa forests need replanting.

POOR PIGS,,,"Pigafetta and his crew-mates feasted on pork during their first Easter Sunday in Asia, still in central Philippine waters. That was on March 31, 1521. Easter is the major Christian feast. It celebrates how Jesus Christ died for the sake of his kind, people who believe in him and his church, allowing them life ever after. The native king sent Magallanes (Pigafetta’s boss) two swine for their meal. Thanks to archaeological work by the Philippine National Museum, we know pork was eaten by Filipino ancestors 7,000 years ago. It would have been hunted pig. The Ifugao of northern Philippines fault an overly curious Malimayu for interfering with a divine effort for zero hunger and that would have spared the lives of pigs and stopped hunting them forever. A piece of pork dripping with blood provided by a magical pig was suppose to give delicious meat always. That way only one wild pig would be sacrificed for the sake of its kind. But Malimayu was unfaithful to the instructions. She squeezed and wrung the pork till it had no more blood and died!

They may have purchased a wild jungle fowl (Gallus bankiva) some historians think. Pigafetta recorded the local word for “galina” to be monoch. It is spelled manok in the languages of Bicol, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Maranaw, Pangasinan, Cebuano, Samar-Leyte, Tagalog; manuk in Pampangan, Ivatan, Maguindanao; manu in Ibanag. In 1613, labuyo meant a wild mountain chicken in Tagalog. Filipinos have been eating chicken for millennia. Archaeologists of the Philippine National Museum found chicken bones at Butuan in Mindanao dating to the 11th and 12th centuries and at Cagayan of northern Luzon in Peñablanca that are 11,000 years old and Lallo, dated as 2,800 years old.",Labuyo; Chicken,Magellan Menu,,,,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,,,https://www.instagram.com/p/B3A4_hkHzA0/

It is claimed Spanish knew the banana before the 1492 voyage of Columbus. Arabs may have brought the banana from its cradle of origin, the Eastern Indies to Europe. The term banana traces perhaps to a West African word, BANAANA.

On February 11, 1522 Victoria left Timor, the last island with fresh supplies. As they crossed from the South Sea to Africa, as Pigafetta wrote: because they had no salt their food putrified. If Portuguese spotted them, their clove and maps would be confiscated. They would all be taken prisoners. After 9 weeks rounding the Cape of Good Hope in tempestuous seas they reached the Atlantic Ocean. They had broken a mast and were leaking. Being in waters where it was legal for them, they stopped at a Portuguese port on Cape Verde Islands for food feigning they had been exploring Spanish America and were heading home. The ruse worked but not for long. Leaving 13 of their men still ashore, Elcano and all who had remained aboard sailed off to avoid the Portuguese sure to give chase.

It is a “very small fish which is netted, dried in the sun or air, then cooked in various ways.” LAULAU ends a paragraph about fish caught at Bonbon Lake in Batangas.
In 1953 an updated checklist of Philippine fishes was published. Sardinella fimbriata, the round-bodied sardine, was called Lao-Lao or Tamban Lao-Lao commonly. It was a marine species that entered river mouths and was abundant in central and southern Philippines. It also lived in waters of East India, the East Indies and China.

In 1890, Jose Rizal published from Paris an annotated version of Morga’s book. He ventured that LAULAU may have been TAWILIS. Today we know tawilis is the world’s only freshwater sardine and is found in Taal Lake, the current name of Bonbon Lake. The Lake was linked to Balayan Bay by Pansipit River, an actively navigated channel. An eruption in 1754, however, silted up the mouth and a narrower river eventually formed nearby. TAWILIS is Sardinella tawilis, not included in the 1953 list. Admittedly the list was a work in progress.

The foods were not reimbursed by currency or barter goods. They were contributed in theory for the protection and organised governance the foreigners were providing. How were the eggs cooked?

It is interesting that he noted: “When used moderately, it is medicinal for the stomach and good for phlegms and other kinds of rhems.

They also had unusual hens with black skin, flesh and bones that tasted good. He meant the ULIKBA that has an antioxidant called carnosine known to be beneficial for human muscles and the nervous system. ULIKBA added to the diet that included native chicken, some wild and others raised under houses built on stilts. Allan Cooper, Director of the Australian Center for Ancient DNA at University of Adelaide found that all ancient chicken bone samples in the Pacific area have a genetic signature unique to only the Philippines and neighbouring areas. It is not identical to the DNA signature of South American chickens, for instance. Did the Philippines become a center for the spread of chickens carried by ancient Polynesians who brought the fowl on their sailing journeys?

Women raised pigs and chickens while men did more physically demanding work in fields or while fishing. They kept house for “husbands and parents” and did excellent needlework, spun cotton, wove blankets. Women were the home cooks. Important is the implied status of women described by Morga: When both men and women go to church or take a walk along the streets, they walk with slow dignified steps accompanied by male and female slaves who always carry parasols to protect them from rain and sun. The ladies walk ahead followed by their female servants and slaves, then their husbands, fathers and brothers follow with their male servants and slaves. He also noted that there was high literacy, with natives writing using what we call today baybayin. It is an indigenous script that was used as early as 300 CE.

The Chinese quarter with its market, food sellers, and artisans is where exposure to Chinese ingredients and cooked food may have taken place. Intramuros had 600 houses where only Spanish could live; another 600 were outside the walls. Fort Santiago had only 30 soldiers and officers; 8 artillery men guarded the Walled City’s gates. There were at least 150 priests of the different orders living at Intramuros. Most Hispanics lived there with the only other places allowed being Cebu, Villa de Arevalo (Iloilo area), Nueva Segovia (Cagayan), Nueva Caceres (Camarines). There were few Spanish settlers and only a few years before Morga arrived was the colony given a budget for 400 pay-soldiers. Natives revolted and the colony was attacked by Chinese pirates and Borneans wanting to retake their trade route. Filipino food had not yet acquired Spanish influences due to few colonials and opportunities to experience their cuisine. New fruits, vegetables, and beef had been introduced as earlier vignettes in #antoniomorga30 noted, but they may not have been widespread yet.

Morga blundered the first maritime battle with the Dutch in 1600 that lost 137 of 200 men on his flagship. His valet removed his armour and they survived by clinging to a floating mattress. The number of resident colonials were far less than needed and those who stayed needed to be in fortified villages. Wives and children came with some of the career officials. How they coped is not recorded. But food was a challenge and it was natives and Chinese overseas workers who provided for the colonials. In 1603, when Morga was to take on a post in Mexico, the Chinese rebelled against unjust measures, burned half of Intramuros, and killed many residents prompting the largest exodus of Spanish who carried out a great amount of personal wealth.

Bobadilla writes, “Those Chinese merchants are so keen after gain that if one sort of merchandise has succeeded well one year, they take a great deal of it the following year.” So every Christmas season the Spanish were brought small oranges, nuts, chestnuts, raisins, plums, flour and more. A Spaniard lost his nose through a certain illness. He likely couldn’t smell his food anymore. He sent for a Chinese to make him one of wood to hide his deformity. It was so well done that the trader was well rewarded. The next year he brought a fine boatload of wooden noses. But in order to sell, writes Bobadilla, “he would have to cut off the noses of all the Spaniards in the colony.” Figuring out what new products the export market desires is a recurring dilemma even today. In a twist of events, the noses of Catholic statuary were chopped off during the Philippine Revolution that started in 1896 because they looked Spanish.",Chinese; Trading,Diego Bob 1616,,,"“Head of a Man,” Diego Velazquez, c. 1616 the year Bobadilla arrived in Manila.

It was carried by Magellan’s voyage of exploration. (See #magellanmenu) Quince couldn’t grow in tropical Philippines. Diego Bobadilla, SJ notes that starfruit, balimbing, birambi (Averrhoa carambola) could be conserved. It tasted like plum when conserved with honey (later sugars) and smelled like quince when ripe on the tree. “Birimbines” conserve was used on galleon trips back to Mexico. It was even ordered by residents there. Native to tropical Southeast Asia, possibly the Moluccas in particular, it spread to the South Pacific and East Asia, although when remains to be traced. ”Carambola” in Spanish means a canon, the sound of a canon, billiards and the sound of billiard balls hitting each other. Was there a military projectile shaped like starfruit?

Perhaps he ate all three. Calamay was a mixture of honey and flour fried in coconut oil. One also could have buchayo (pronounced boo-kah-yoh ) made of coconut or sesame seed. The terms conserva, buchayo and turron were interchangeable then. Four centuries later, pili turron was included among Philippine creole recipes. Turron means nougat. Introduced to Spain, and possibly first made in Jijona, during Moorish times it combines almond, egg white and honey.

So far we have enumerated since 1521 sugarcane chewed for its sweet juice, honeys and coconut syrup (miel de coco also called polot tuba). There are others for which there is written evidence. They were explained as the native “miel de caña,” sugarcane syrup the Spanish knew. But local versions were: polot panilan (honey from beehive); polot sasa (nipa); polot buli (buri). The latter two are palms like the coconut; the process of making honey from their sap is identical to that of polot tuba. Another important word in “sweet history” from the years being studied is BALÁS. In Pampangan, Cebuano and Tagalog it means crystallised syrup, granulated syrup. Syrups could have been from palms. The progression from syrup to solidified sugar and granules is easily imagined. In 1613 an active Tagalog word was PACASCAS. It was “curds like sugar sold in small baskets by Indios at the Parian [market] of Manila.” To a Spaniard “like sugar” probably meant like sugarcane granules. Pacascas is palm sugars. BAGKAT in Pampangan and Tagalog was likewise active: syrup cooked into a soft candy. When defining Philippine cuisine, precolonial sweeteners have an important role.

They probably rejoiced that Chinese traders annually brought what they hungered for: sugarcane sugar, once called “sweet salt” by Crusader-Knights who saw it for the first time. Sugarcane was known in ancient China but not till the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) was refining done. Around 727 Emperor Tai-Tsung sent a delegation to Magadha in India to learn how to turn sugarcane juice into much desired sugar crystals called “tang” in Chinese. From 766-779, a monk in Sichuan taught how to make rock sugar: boiling cane juice into a sticky liquid and letting it flow down a bamboo pipe into an urn where crystals formed. During the subsequent Sung Dynasty (960-1279) sugarcane became a top cash crop in Sichuan and the area from where Chinese workers in the Philippines came, Fukien. There were enough imported ingredients for Spanish to make some of their favourite homeland sweets: sugar, flour, olive oil, pork lard, almonds, raisins among others. But did they? Proof still needed. Natives outside Intramuros were still being converted to Catholicism, coaxed to live in a pueblo where a church would be built, and learn Spanish foods and customs.Two culinary systems for pleasing sweet desires were starting to meet.

He lists 4 cultivated ones. CAMOTE is a sweet potato, Ipomomea batatas. He writes it is the “potatoes of Spain” eaten by colonised and colonisers alike. There is APARI that a 19th-century source describes as white inside, nicely flavoured and called BARIBARAN in Borongan, Samar. UBI is an edible root characterised by a 1613 source as a hand-span or longer and white. A fourth kind was LAQUI. “Mountains furnish roots from which [natives] draw their most usual nourishment,” he added. One was PUGAIAN and the other COROT (Dioscorea triphylla or pentaphylla L.), a yam. Wild tubers were famine food, fallback when cultivated crops failed. Camote was often used as a generic term for all tubers, whatever their genus. How was camote cooked during Bobadilla’s time? He doesn’t say, however a few years before he arrived there is a document. LABON meant cooking a large quantity of tubers or meat. If it was a small amount of tubers it was as LAGA, in the juice or syrup of sugarcane (or likely plain water also). Cooking tubers in water was also called CQISA (gisa) but not referring to today’s stir-frying or complex stewing. Gisa then meant to cook rice, to make SAING that was done by cooking rice (or in this case, tuber) in water. Bobadilla has left insights into heritage cooking.

Leaves were half a meter long and half that wide. Bananas recorded in the 1600s are saba, (healthy and good), bongolan (aromatic, green skinned), bangalan (aromatic, yellow, short), borohan (wild, lots of seeds, sweet), tanyanuang (very long) and sungay cambing (small, short, literally meaning horn of a goat). Some could be cooked in water. Banana originated in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. Arabs brought it westward from India. Varieties from the Americas (originally from Africa) would be introduced to the Philippines.

Some mats were specifically woven for heavy duty agricultural uses, others finer for everyday functions, and still others so artistically decorated with symbols and colours for ceremonies like those marking rites of passage. The banig is a precious element of Philippine culture to sustain. Bobadilla explained that while common eating was on banana leaves at ground level, the wealthy dined on low tables. They would have been sitting on mats as Pigafetta noted and the tables were low. Dulang is what Tagalogs call the low table that comes in many sizes. Several dulang can be placed end to end for large banquets. Important has been that one could eat with others.",Banig; Dulang,Diego Bob 1616,,,"“Una comida entre gente acomodada” from the Luis Ma.

The latter vessel had 3 layers of stations for rowers on each side. Manpower could reach 100 natives per boat. CARACOA were used as trading ships to carry dried fish, wine, salt, wax, cotton, coconut and other like merchandise in an active coastal trade. Spanish traded wax, storax, Ivory, bezoar in Borneo and Camboa. Two or three Portuguese ships from Macao brought silk, musk, precious stones and fragrant woods. Chinese traders noted in earlier posts brought persimmon and other fruit, parasols, porcelain, cloths the black ones used by Indians, paste gems, thread and the most esteemed whitest silk. Galleons larger than those in the Mediterranean were built at Manila where abaca was used for rigging. The galleon also transported missionaries. A subsidy was added for an outfit of clothing “they are won’t to wear,” a mattress, a blanket and straw for the voyage. Missionaries often lacked enough funds to cover meals while waiting for their galleons to leave Spain and Mexico. Part of their small royal subsidy ended up as handouts demanded at ports by petty bureaucrats.

He explained fears that were real to the draftees: there was neither bread nor wine; the sea terrified; seasickness could keep them flat on their backs the entire trip; strange climate and illnesses could kill them. The Jesuit Pedro de Montes and his group of 20 Jesuits were assigned 3 ordinary cabins 10 feet long by 8 feet wide, and a fourth cabin slightly larger. A group of Jesuits traveling in 1625 had to lie with the feet of one resting on the head of another. Their cabin was a cubbyhole under the quarterdeck. They had to keep their ration of hard sea biscuit that attracted weevils beside them. Their door was so blocked with gear that they crawled into the cabin like cats. No one took off their clothes and soon vermin the size of chickpea attached to them, sucked their blood, and infested their food. At the stopover in Acapulco, bureaucrats refused to lodge them.

It was then that they could taste Mexican cooking in the convents. The typical Pacific crossing was about 75 days. Perhaps because Bobadilla’s family was well known in Madrid and had royal connections, his group was assigned to the smaller of two galleons crossing the Pacific. The priests had a luggage room and the entire quarterdeck to themselves; Bobadilla even had his own room. The captain gave half of his accommodations at the poop deck in addition. They set up an infirmary on the portside for many who fell sick. They even fashioned a refectory on the poop deck using the passageway as a kitchen.

At one descent, 11,000 steps were cut into the path. At Pangil village on the lakeshore, a lay brother awaited them with a “hot meal of enormous proportion,” Horacio de la Costa, SJ recounts in the history of his order published by Harvard University Press in 1961. The alcalde mayor provided boats that sailed them from the lake down Pasig River to the Walled City where bells pealed in welcome. Recruits adjusted to their new island home and its customs. They learned not to fear the foreign. There was local bread made from Japanese flour at the capital. At their assigned rural stations they ate rice like those they sought to make fine Christians: using their fingers. In the first 100 years of mission work, fervent piety ignited men like Bobadilla.

Chinese used it to cook meat quickly in a pot, likely meaning it helped as a tenderiser. The Spanish called it lemoncito (small lemon). In Pampanga, the focus of our new set of food stories, MIDALAYAP meant to use dalayap in cooking. When two men became godfathers to the same child they were referred to as MICADALAYAP, also meaning that they had a “spiritual relationship” with the child’s father according to Fr. Diego Bergaño, OSA in 1732. He added the term MICADALANDAN, meaning the spiritual relationship of a child’s parents and godparents. The dalandan was an orange species of citrus.

In the 1700s Pampanga cooked the hierbas called CANCUNG (kangkong in Tagalog today) with venison to good results. It was also made into salad. The smooth vine trailed on mud or floated on stagnant pools. Also eaten was LIBATO (alugbati in Tagalog). Other herbs eaten were LUCAY (its flowers were called TUNAS, its roots TUCAL), SÁLAY and LUPA. Too much of the latter was injurious. Although this series is to help us get a sense of what Philippine cuisine was like in the second colonial century, 1665-1764, here are some wild Pampangan hierbas from 157 years later. In the 1700s as in earlier years not all ingredients needed to be cultivated in one’s garden. TUNGKUT-LAÑGIT (Helminthostachys zeylanica L.) was a wild fern. So was PAKÓ (Athyrium esculentum) widely distributed on gravel beds and banks of swift streams. Their young fronds were eaten raw as a salad, as well as cooked as a vegetable. PAPATANI was a vine growing wild in thickets. The seeds were said to be edible but possibly poisonous.

What indigenized according to Manuel Blanco, OSA by the 1800s was Capsicum minimum with a tiny fruit. It was known as Pasitis in his time and grew everywhere, even uncultivated. Except in Pampanga, its old name LARA had been forgotten. In the 1700s lara indeed was in use. MANLARA was to add lara as an ingredient in Pampangan food to make it hot and pungent according to the Bergano dictionary. It seems not everyone liked pungency because PANLARAN was putting chili into someone’s food, knowing he would not eat it. In pre-lara times, the prick in Pampangan cuisine came from LAYA (Amomum zingiber), ginger. The root must have figured in abundance because MALAYA meant an abundance of ginger. In the Visayas of 1521, raw ginger was served separately to accompany roasted fish. BAUANG was the Pampanga term for garlic (Allium sativum) that if eaten raw gave piquancy too. In Cebu of 1521 LAXUNA (pronounced lah-su-nah) meant garlic. LASONA was the term for “cebolla,” onion in Pampanga during the 1700s. But was lasona then the Allium cepa, shallot also called little onion? LASUNA in Ilocos and Pangasinan still means shallot. The Spanish onion that is large, yellowish and considered sweet is also an Allium; so is the Mexican bulb onion which is white that is not sweet. During a trip to Jakarta in the mid-1980s, bawang had become the term for related herbs, all of the Allium genus: daun bawang lalap (small, bulbous spring onions eaten raw); bawang putih (garlic, already sold then as loose cloves or full bulbs); bawang merah (shallots that were deep red to purple, flavourful and used sliced or pounded; deep fried slices were a garnish). In Manila of the 1950s and 1960s the big bulb onion was called SIBUYAS BOMBAY. In Jakarta it was sold as bawang Bombay, the onion for European-influenced Indonesian dishes. Indeed it seems that early Pampanga cooking likely used shallots and not the European bulb onion.

Sugarcane land was called PANAYBUAN. Sugar mills were termed at the time CAB-BIYAO. Animals like a carabao provided power for a mill or press. LANSI was sediment from honey or hard sugar. Diego Bergaño, OSA records the saying, “Malansi cang bina”. Perhaps honey was preferred to the sugar of that era because it roughly means “What appears to be honey is just hard sugar underneath”. CARAMELO also existed, a hard sugar cube that when bitten on caused LANGUBNGUB, the sound made by teeth. Sugar was cooked with lakatan banana to make a mixture called INANGIT. It also was mixed with wheat flour and fried into small round cakes called BARUYA. Honey too was used in cooking. It made BARILI, a sauce for meat and fish. BAGCAT was a paste made of toasted corn kernels ground with honey. With ginger, honey made SALABAT, a beverage. PANIMAGAS was an active word meaning sweets like preserves eaten to end a meal. DULOT was serving a combination or oranges and suman at the end of a meal; it also meant food at table given to children and relatives. BUCAYO already existed as a conserve or a jam, but when conjugated as MABUCAYO it meant to become preserved or inferior sugar.

Pampanga’s parishes were upstream and not along the bay when in 1732 Fr. Bergano’s dictionary was first released. The word lists for languages of island residents such as in the Visayas have many fish types included. Not so in the Bergano book although not all fish and seafood may have been listed. ASAN is fish in general in Pampangan; MASAN is to eat a meal or fish. Perhaps the fish he included were the most popular ones or the ones he personally ate: ALUBEBAY like a sardine; BIA that was white; DILIS that was white and “good to eat”. A fish could mean more than being a fish. The delicious BUANBUAN was white-scaled and boney. It also meant an untarnished weapon or sword. Fish had power and nobleness associated with it. The CABASI fish gave its name to a kind of texture or weave. ITO was a fish without scales and figured in an adage: NOCARIN MALUN MO ALAN BIYAYAN ITO. The translation by Fr. Venancio Samson is: Where there are waves [such as the sea] no ITO can thrive. He explains that in the 18th-century it implied that every part of the sea has waves; wherever one goes there will be work to be done always. Other common fish of the era’s diet were the mud fish DALAG and TABANGONGO also called CANDOLE. The Pampangan table also served ALIMASAG, sea crab; PARUS, mussels or [other] shellfish; ULANG, prawns or large shrimp. MANULANG was to go looking to catch them specifically.

That was in 1521 by Antonio Pigafetta. In the 1700s Pampanga cuisine was still employing the technique. Its vocabulary was highly developed with specific words for the way roasting was done. DARANG and NANGNANG were generic for roasting, asar (to roast) and asado (that which is roasted) in Spanish. Proof of fish being roasted at the time is the word BELITA, meaning to roast an entire fish from head to tail. SUBSUB was to move sausages or other food “closer to embers so they would roast better”. DUMIRI was the dripping of fat or grease as well as the sizzle made when roasting. Bergaño used “longaniza” as his example, suggesting that specific term for sausage was active in Pampanga. He did not use chorizo, for instance. One had to know how to roast well or what one roasted could end up criticised as BANTILAO, an adjective for being half-roasted or half-cooked. MANTILAO meant that food was cooked in that manner such as when there were many guests. Pigafetta had described food he ate in the Visayas as half-cooked.
One could “roast or toast” in a pan and not only over an open fire in the 1700s. In Pampanga, rice and corn kernels became BILUTUG when roasted or toasted (IBILUTUG) in a pan (termed BILITUGAN).",Antonio Pigafetta; Roasting; ,Pampaga 1732,,,Dreamstime.com,,Image;Still Image,image/jpeg,,public domain,,https://www.instagram.com/p/CRS9UF2jHCl/?hl=en

That was the 1521 chronicle by Antonio Pigafetta when he was in the Visayas with Magellan. The Bergaño vocabulary documents that Pampangans in the 1700s had boiled dishes, likely as did their early ancestors. ITUN and TUMAN meant to cook and to boil. LUTU was boiled or cooked food; IYAGLUTO was to cook or prepare food. ALPA existed then as a term for “boiled food”. IYAYALPA meant boiled ingredients like squash and radish, two botanicals brought by the galleon trade. Everyone knew that MALALPA was very soft rice cooked with too much water. It’s opposite was GAGTO, rice cooked with insufficient water. ABIAS meant specifically to make “nasi,” cooked rice. Because of the word TAMBONG we can assume meat and vegetables were boiled to make a viand. TAMBONG or MANAMBONG was also used for boiled “ears of corn” and camotes, two more New World botanical immigrants that indigenized. At least one more word proves Pampangans boiled to cook: TUN, conjugated as ITUN and TUMUN.

Bergaño explains that IBANGLI and MANGLI mean to dip something in boiling water: such as a lemon [meaning a native citrus used in place of Spanish lemon, most likely] or some other fruit to tenderise it and extract juice easily. Today’s chefs could attempt repeating the antique flavouring process. BANLI is also the 1732 synonym of SALCOCHAR, meaning there can be SAL, salt, in the boiling water. In English, parboil is short for partially boiled, to submerge and boil food briefly and lightly over heat. Blanch is similar but infers immersing briefly in boiling water, about a minute whereas parboiling could take longer. Thus are the subtle differences between the two techniques, it seems. BANLI is more parboiling than blanching. In Tagalog of 1613, it is HABLOS, meat or fish [placed] in boiling water — SANCOCHAR in Spanish.

SANGKUTSA does not yet appear in Pampangan or Tagalog dictionaries of the early to mid 1700s. Today, it is traced to SALCOCHAR, to boil in salted water. But it could be from SANCOCHAR, to cook in boiling water quickly a raw ingredient. Both Spanish words share COCHO in their etymologies; cocho from

It is a word shared throughout the islands due to its use by missionaries in sermons about Christ as the bread of life and his miracle of the loaves and fish, for instance. In 1521 when TINAPAY was first recorded in writing, Antonio Pigafetta defined it as a certain type of rice cake in Cebu. To knead in Tagalog is TAPAY; the result is TINAPAY, na tapay. In Pampanga there was the root word AMAS conjugated as MANAMAS, meaning “to knead” so a synonym of tapay? MANAMAS was also that with which or what is put into the dough, like mixing; it is also that which is kneaded. We learn that rice and wheat flours were combined from MIAMAS, meaning “with company like rice flour with wheat flour”. MACAYAMAS is what is mixed in the dough. Typical of our languages, the root word (AMAS) shows its flexibility. Similarly YAMAS is recorded. As MANIAMAS it is not only to knead; it can also mean mixing good and bad. If one wonders what ingredients AMAS and YAMAS could knead into dough, one ingredient is honey. Pampangans in the 1700s used honey in their dough, if we follow the translation of “miel” selected by Fr. Venancio Q. Samson to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude for his work. The word miel means honey, however it came to also mean sugarcane and palm juices cooked till thick like honey.

A cooking vessel can sit on the tripod. In Pampanga of the 1700s TUNGCO was the three stones. So it was too in Tagalog that spelled it TONGCÔ in the early 1600s. Tagalog in 1613 had already also incorporated the word CALÁN, an earthenware brazier used in cooking by the natives. Bergaño lists CALANG as an earthenware stove in the 1700s. He describes it as having “three feet” similar to a tungco. The kalan shape has varied over time. Its advantages are that it is portable and keeps cooking coals contained and off the ground. The kalan came in many sizes. Its solid base or feet raise the part holding hot coals or firewood thereby protecting any flooring beneath it, such as a boat’s. Arsenio Manuel suggests the kalan like the kawa and its small version the kawali (the affix LI implying small) are Chinese in origin.",Arsenio Manuel; Fire,Pampaga 1732,,,Detail showing a kalan a century after Bergaño published the first Pampanga dictionary.

TIDTAD was the dish made with minced meat. Until a meat grinder was invented, mincing was the technique around the world to make the tiniest pieces of meat. There likely was the use of eggs beaten till foamy because MANYBUL from the root word SABUL means to raise a foam, such as when beating eggs. What used beaten egg? Another example from Bergaño is the foam in water made by rowing. Proof that spit roasting was done are the words MANLAID and LAIRAN that mean to baste meat on a spit. A feather or a brush was used to baste, to apply lard. LEIRAN was that being basted. Lechon means the spit-roasted fiesta pig, but it is also used nowadays to mean anything cooked on a spit, such as chicken. DALDAC is to pound or crush something into pieces, such as in a mortar or vat. The term could apply to garlic used in cooking. GATA is coconut milk. MANGGATTA is to extract the milk by squeezing wet coconut gratings. The serrated scraper is used all over the former Austronesian migration and trade region and is an efficient improvement on simply scraping off coconut meat with a blade. When the “kabayo” version of the serrated scraper attached to a seat evolved still needs dating. APIÂ is to draw out juice by pressing or squeezing. It can apply to citrus and other fruits. An intriguing term, as translated by Samson, is TANGCAP, meaning embellished, dressed, seasoned, “neatly” cleaned or finished... thus making things MANANGCAP, ready for cooking.

MIASIN was to put salt, according to Bergaño. CALAT was saltiness and ALAT, salty. BAGUC meant to both brine and pickle. (Today, BAGÚK is the synonym of bagoong, brined shrimp or fish. Bagoong is used in Tagalog; balaw and hingmay in Bikol; ginamos in Hiligaynon, Cebuano, Samar-Leyte; bagóng in Ibanag; bug-goong in Ilocano; inasín in Pangasinan.) PIBABAGUCAN was the container for brining. BURO was an adjective for something like fish or santol that had been put in salt that would become a brining liquid or solution. (One finds BURO having the same meaning in Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Pangasinan, Cebuano, and Tagalog.) One could salt beef and string it up to dry, a process call MALAING from the root word BALAING. Preserved beef was called BELAINGAN. There was salted fish called TAGUILAO that did not last long, however, because it used less salt than a BURU. (In Tagalog of 1613, TAGHILAO referred to fish, meat, beef that was salted.) While BUSBUS was to open a fish, DAING meant to open up a fish so as to salt it. Bergaño defined TAPA as meat or fish cut open or sliced on the diagonal, stretched wide,and marinated in salt and vinegar before roasting or frying; MANAPA was to prepare meat or fish the TAPA way.

There is no written evidence, however. “Pimiento” (black peppercorn) was identified as LARA by Bergaño. But LARA he defined as both pepper[corn] and chili. Bergaño does not identify what was made into ASLAM, vinegar. MANASLAM was to make vinegar. He does note that there was TUBA made of LIAB, the word for buri palm sap.

Francisco de San Antonio, OFM defines DOLANG in 1624 as a table or a large plate where one eats. It could be used poetically, too, as in “Naging dolang ang mata co” [My eyes became a dolang], implying delight in what one was seeing. In Bergaño’s Pampangan dictionary, DULANG is a low table, about a foot high, for dining. MAGDULANG or MIDULANG was to eat meals on it. Like San Antonio for Tagalog, Bergaño annotates uses of the word.

The word and its meaning were listed by Antonio Pigafetta of the first circumnavigation crew in 1521. He found it used by Malay speakers of the Spice Islands. Pampangan conjugated the noun into multiple meanings: MAMING-GAN, to place something on the plate; PIPING-GANAN, the plates used for serving and not those in reserve; MACAPING-GAN, to be on the plate. Bergaño added that MIPING-GAN meant “with company,” as in two persons eating from the same plate. He added “but not [eating] rice” that way. The terms give insight into meal customs. SUIC was the small porcelain plate used for salt and, perhaps by Spanish, for mustard. There was a large plate, the TAPAC, but no description of it survives. There were also bowls such as SUL-LIAO, possibly big, and LAMPAY that was bigger. MANGCOC was a cup to drink water from. One wonders about its size said to be bigger than a sul-liao, as well as its material. Half a small coconut, the BUO and half a larger coconut, the DUBASA were drinking cups. The latter could have multiple functions. CALAMBA and TABOAN were pitchers. The calamba had a “large narrow mouth”. In other languages it meant a pot. From the definition of SAQUID one learns that water was drawn out using a ladle, big spoon, or cupped hands. There was the GABOC, a porcelain jar with a cover but it likely was not for use at table. A vessel with water so ants could not climb into it was termed LAMPACAN. Even today items become unreachable by ants if they or their containers sit in a “moat”.

When conjugated as MALANTONG it meant a person who was a flatterer. Clearly a priest wrote the definitions because Bergaño noted that a MALANTONG had many flattering excuses but “brought no alms”. Scorched rice had a peculiar smell: MALANGNIS. EPASANGÓ was an intolerable smell, and “much more if it is the odour of hell,” added Bergaño. Being able to smell unsafe ingredients, food, and surroundings kept a person healthy. Words to describe the lack or surfeit of salt have yet to be found and yet many ancestral cooks claimed to have corrected flavouring by smell and not taste. Or could they have been smelling the viand as a whole sonata, and if something were out of tune, deducing that it was salt that was the missing note? How many cooks today smell rancidness or salt missing in their cooking pot?",Diego Bergaño; Smell,Pampaga 1732,,,Bad smell.

The word proves eating a fruit on the side was done. ULAM is a viand and MANULAM is one who eats many viands with rice. ALAYAN described a plate atop which were different foods, a practice done when serving “lords and elderly”. MANALAYAN was to put different foods on a plate. DULUT according to Bergaño was food at table given to children and relations; food put on a plate without approval of the recipient by a servant, a slave, or a “younger boarder” in charge of serving. On Holy Thursday, CABA, food on a plate or in a basket was taken to feed the poor. On regular days CABA could be donated to a convent. TAGAN meant leftovers from a meal (also remnants when cutting fabric for clothing). ABAO also meant leftover food such as from a banquet or a dinner and that was being kept to serve at the next meal. MICABOCABAN not only meant keeping leftovers for tomorrow, or tomorrow’s leftovers for some other day, but leaving today’s work for some other time. The word selection hints at how life proceeded in the 1700s.",Diego Bergaño; Leftovers; Eating,Pampaga 1732,,,"Mango painted by Jose Lozano in 1850.

AGCAT also referred to one who tagged along with or who was invited by the invitee. The guest was also called the CANGAYAN and the QUENGAYAN. Kindly note that the G is pronounced softly. At all occasions PACUNDANGAN was expected: politeness. Bergaño cites MAMATAS, to regulate such as is done with food so everyone gets an equal share when there is a crowd around food. PETASAN is the share given in identical amounts. Children then are like children now. They were notorious for MANYAYIT, to keep picking up tidbits of food not just to taste but to eat the dainties being served till nothing was left. SUMULU and MANYULU mean to enter and join those at table who are already eating. It also is used for a dog that arrives. The guest to be wary of is one who is TAMASA, ease-loving, spoiled, and stopping at nothing to get a free meal. MAGTAMASA is one glutting at a baptism or wedding. The 24 posts are a glimpse into culinary culture of Pampanga through just some of the hundreds of words collected by Fr. Diego Bergaño published in 1732. On Saturday we will compare his work with Tagalog of 1754.",Diego Bergaño; Fiesta; Customs; Manners,Pampaga 1732,,,Detail of a carinderia by Jose Lozano.
